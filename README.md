# College Scorecard Data Analysis 
Author: Ariel Anderson

# Introduction 
According to the [U.S. Department of Social Security](https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/research-summaries/education-earnings.html), college graduates net higher lifetime earnings than peers without a bachelor's or graduate degree. Yet, the [National Center for Educational Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=98) shows that enrollment in 4 year institutions has steadily fallen. Rising tuition costs, increased competition, lack of educational preparedness, student debt burden, and relative value of specific degree types may be factors in determining why enrollment has fallen. This is an exploratory project which examines various variables that could be contributing to decreased enrollement. The project also explores variables that may contribute to a student's success and lifetime earnings. This project was develope using publically accessible data from the [U.S. Department of Education College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/).
